Problem set 1


Question 1

A common problem in computer science is finding patterns within data. 
This problem will simulate that in a way that is easy to see what is happening.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.
Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers.

an anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another.


Given a String S, determine if it is an anagram of a palindrome. 
Return true if the String is an anagram of a palindrome, and false otherwise. 
For example, the String “oatrtro” will return true (rotator), while the String “false” will return false.

public static boolean anagram() {
	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
	String input = scan.next();
	//YOUR CODE HERE
	return false;
}
